# Decision Tree classification on Airline data
##  Project Overview
Construct and evaluate a decision tree classification model to predict customer satisfaction based on prevoius customer feedback. Decision trees accurately predicted satisfaction over 94 percent of the time. 
## Business understanding
The project is based on details of customer feedback for Invistico Airlines (a fictional name). Being able to predict customer satisfaction will enable the company to concentrate on required areas thereby improving its profit.
## Data Understanding
This activity uses a dataset called Invistico_Airline.csv. The dataset contains: 23 columns of customer feedback, each row representing one customer’s responses. Note that responses were given on a 0 to 5 scale, 0 meaning “not at all satisfied” and 5 meaning “very satisfied.” The dataset contains:129,880 rows – each row is a different customer response ; and 23 columns
The dataset can be found on Kaggle.
## Modeling and Evaluation

Decision trees accurately predicted satisfaction over 94 percent of the time. The confusion matrix is useful as it shows a similar number of true positives and true negatives.
## Conclusion
The success of the model suggests that the airline should invest more effort into model building and model understanding since this model semed to be very good at predicting customer satisfaction.
